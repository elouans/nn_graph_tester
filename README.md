Script which generates a function, plots it, then analyzes the difference between another plotted result.
Basic workflow is copy paste the image into a llm with the prompt: "As accurate as possible, give the function that generated this plot".
Compare the plot of the output function with the source plot, and you get a decent metric for quantifying performance. :sunglasses:
